## WinXcorners
WinXcorners is a lightweight utility for Windows 10 and Windows 11 that enhances your desktop experience by allowing you to assign custom actions triggered when you hover your mouse cursor over the corners of your main monitor. Whether you're a power user, developer, or just someone who appreciates efficiency, WinXcorners provides a seamless way to streamline your workflow.

## Key Features

1. **Corner Actions**: Choose from a variety of predefined actions for each corner:
    <details>
        <summary>
            <strong>Show All Windows:</strong> Activate Windows' Task View `Win`+`Tab` to manage your open applications.
        </summary>

    </details>
    
    - [x] **Show Desktop**: Quickly minimize all windows and reveal the desktop.
    - [x] **Start Screen Saver**: Trigger your screen saver for privacy or energy-saving purposes.
    - [x] **Turn Off Monitors**: Conveniently turn off your display when not in use.
    - [x] **Start Menu**: Invoke the Start Menu on hovering a corner.
    - [x] **Action Center**: Invoke the Action Center without hassle.
    - [x] **Hide Other Windows**: Just like `Win`+`Home`.

2. **Customization**: Tailor WinXcorners to your preferences:
    - Assign different actions to different corners.
    - Fine-tune hover sensitivity and delay settings.
    - Enable or disable automatic startup with Windows.

3. **System Tray Integration**: WinXcorners runs discreetly in the system tray, ensuring it doesn't clutter your desktop or Taskbar.

4. **Unobstrusive**: Its usage won't interfere with your common tasks, unless you decide to do so.
    - It won't trigger actions while dragging content with your mouse.
    - It won't trigger while using a Full Screen application, like games or media, for instance.

5. **Visible Countdown Counter**: Helps you, visually, to know if a corner action is about to be triggered (Advanced feature).

## Installation (Portable)
1. Download the latest release from the GitHub repository.
2. Just unzip into a secure folder.
3. Run the single small executable, settings will be written/saved there.

## Usage
1. Launch WinXcorners popup window from the system tray icon.
2. Configure your preferred actions for each corner.
3. Hover your mouse cursor over a corner to trigger the assigned action.

## Advanced Usage
1. Right click the WinXcorners tray icon.
2. Select **Advanced** to open the more advanced options.
3. There you can:
    - Set a global delay, so the action will trigger after some few seconds.
    - Set specific delay for each corner.
    - Enable or Disable the triggering of actions while on Full Screen applications, it can also be done via the right click on the system tray icon for WinXcorners.
4. Add up to 4 custom actions: Just write the commands and its respective arguments to launch, set hidden launch or visible. 

## Notes
- WinXcorners works seamlessly on your primary monitor but secondary monitors haven't been tested throughfully, consider it partially supported.
- If you encounter issues with elevated privileges software, try restarting WinXcorners as an administrator specially if you use those kind of elevated privileged software most of the time, otherwise triggering won't work due to the nature of separate privileges.
- If you encounter other unknown issues, please fill a bug report at the GitHub issues page.

And when you are going to play video games, it includes a toggle option that will disable it temporarily.

![snp3](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VrZ2zw8gfmo/Vh-zhP_UljI/AAAAAAAALQg/aqqvlB79QhQ/WinXCorners%25255B7%25255D%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800)

The application runs in the System Tray, by right clicking you can enable it to run when Windows starts (logon).

![snp4](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7ja-oixZ058/Vh-zjp8pRpI/AAAAAAAALQo/h4y4EPuoBbY/WinXCorners%25255B9%25255D%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800)

Limitations:

    The application won't detect the screen edges if you are using (focused) an elevated privileged application. But you can always restart the application as administrator.
    If you have multiple monitors, it won't work in a secondary monitor.
